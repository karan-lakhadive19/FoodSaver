# FoodSaver

## Problem Statement

For many people in the world, food waste has become a habit:buying more food than we need at markets, letting fruits and vegetables spoil in the fridge.
These habits put extra strain on our natural resources and damage our environment. When we waste food, we waste the labour, effort, investment and precious resources (like water, seeds, feed, etc.) that go into producing it, not to mention the resources that go into transporting and processing it. 
In short, wasting food increases greenhouse gas emissions and contributes to climate change. Reducing food loss and waste is essential in a world where millions of people go hungry every day.

To reduce this, I developed an application which keeps track of what is in your fridge with expiry dates.

## Features Included
1. Input to the application can be item name and its expiry date.
2. It displays whether the item has been expired or how much days left to expire.
3. It gives you the recipes that can be prepared using the items in the fridge.
